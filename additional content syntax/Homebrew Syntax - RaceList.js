/*	-WHAT IS THIS?-
	The script featured here is an explanation of how to make your own custom addition to MPMB's D&D 5e Character Tools.
	You can add custom content to the Character Sheet's functionality by adding a script written with the syntax shown below in the "Add Custom Script" dialogue.
	
	-KEEP IN MIND-
	Note that you can add as many custom codes as you want, but you have to add the code in at once (i.e. copy all the code into a single, long file and copy that into the sheet).
	It is recommended to enter the code in a fresh sheet before adding any other information.
*/

/*	-INFORMATION-
	Subject:	Class
	Effect:		This is the syntax for adding a new race to the sheet
				Note that you will need to define the race once for every sub-race (i.e. there is a separate entry for High Elf, Wood Elf, and Dark Elf)
				For races that have variants, like the human, you can define a variant using the RaceSubList. Any variant defined like that will only be selectable through the "Racial Options" button
	Sheet:		v12.83 (2017-02-18)

						// You can change the attributes of the "fields" object with the eval-string of atkAdd to affect what is put into the fields.
					
						// You can use the attributes of the "fields" object with the eval-string of atkCalc to check for things, but changing them will have no effect on the sheet.
					
						// With the atkCalc you have to change the "output" object in order to affect the outcome of the calculations. This object has the following attributes: output.prof (wether or not to add the proficiency bonus to the To Hit), output.die (Damage Die to use), output.mod (ability modifier), output.modToDmg (wether or not to add the ability modifier to Damage), output.magic (any magic bonus that's to be added to both To Hit and Damage), output.bHit (the To Hit bonus from the Blue Text/Modifier field), output.bDmg (the Damage bonus from the Blue Text/Modifier field), output.extraHit (a number added to the To Hit that is reserved for this eval), output.extraDmg (a number added to the damage that is reserved for this eval)
